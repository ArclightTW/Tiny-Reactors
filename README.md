### About

Tiny Reactors is a Minecraft mod developed for Minecraft 1.12.2.  It is a power generation mod that can either be used passively or actively, depending on several configuration settings modifiable by the mod user.

For additional information on new blocks, items and various mechanics, please review the new Wiki!

### Notes

__The new face of the Tiny Reactors project!__  

_Where has all the content gone?_  
It has been moved [here](https://github.com/ArclightTW/Tiny-Reactors-OUTDATED) to allow a fresher and cleaner project to take over.  

_My game is crashing when upgrading from Tiny Reactors pre-v1.0!_  
Tiny Reactors is undergoing a substantial rewrite to make things cleaner, more modular and far more efficient to run.  As a result, any mod version from 1.0-SNAPSHOT (the first "new" build) upwards will be completely incompatible with old versions of the project.  You will need to remove all reactor instances from your world before upgrading to the newest release.  

_X is missing from the mod!_  
Per the above points, Tiny Reactors is undergoing a major overhaul, both in terms of aesthetics and functionality.  As a result, a variety of Blocks and Items will be added or removed compared to previous versions.  Please review the update notes of each release as these will include detailed notes to what has been changed.  

_X has been added and I don't know how it works!_  
As with previous versions, Tiny Reactors will __(eventually)__ contain an in-game manual that explains all the functionality of all the Blocks and Items the mod adds.  In the meantime, however, please review the Wiki pages for details on what everything does and how it can be used.
